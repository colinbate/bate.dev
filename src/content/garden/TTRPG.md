> Tabletop Roleplaying Games (or TTRPGs) are a category of game that has its roots in the 70s and the creation of Dungeons and Dragons (or D&D). Throughout the past 50 years, the hobby has morphed into a whole ecosystem, one where any number of games and systems have been developed that fuel a creative effort from people playing and running these games. You can think of it as like a board game, but one where the story or the motivation or the adventure, if you will, behind the game is being driven by one of the participants, known as a Game Master (or GM), who essentially is telling a collaborative story, adjudicating based on a set of rules that are usually dictated by the game system mechanics. The GM, however, typically is the final arbiter of what is allowed to happen.

I've been actively playing TTRPGs for about 5 years now.

I have given intro sessions for colleagues in the past. I'm planning to give a [[TTRPG 101]] talk at the [[Bermuda Library]].
