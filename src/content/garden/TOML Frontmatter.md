Despite the popular frontmatter choice being YAML, I am not a fan of YAML, and I am a fan of TOML. I've been using it for frontmatter since ~2014 when I created a Hugo site, converting a ton of old database-bound content into markdown with TOML metadata.

Instead of the usual YAML delimited of `---` (three dashes), the normal convention with TOML is to use `+++` (three pluses).
