I've been interested in the [[PKM]] space for ~5 years now. In that time I've played around with an number of apps.

There were tools out there to take your existing graphs and publish them, but my real brain wouldn't let me just do that. I had to try to build it myself.

Since my existing site was done with Astro, I wanted to see if I could build a garden with Astro. In my journey I found out there is another tool that is aiming to do something similar called [BrainDB](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com/recipes/braindb/)

So with the help of [[Claude]], I whipped something together. It's not perfect, but it's a start.
