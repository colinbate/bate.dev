The introductory presentation that I'm planning to run at the [[Bermuda Library]] in September 2025.

It will be an hour long, and my goal is to introduce people to the concept of role-playing games. Hopefully some will go on to playing in or running their own games.

I will be providing more resources and notes over at https://ttrpg.tools once I've created them.
