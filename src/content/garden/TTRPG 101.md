The introductory presentation that I'm planning to run at the [[Bermuda Library]] on 16 September 2025.

It will be an hour long, and my goal is to introduce people to the concept of role-playing games. Hopefully some will go on to playing in or running their own games.

I will be providing more resources and notes over at https://ttrpg.tools once I've created them.

Preparing for this presentation has caused me to discover that the Mac version of ChatGPT has a [[Record mode]], which allows for recording audio sessions up to two hours in length.

Using AI to critique my presentation has been quite helpful. First in terms of availability. I don't have many friends who aren't already familiar with the content to practice with. And the AI is always ready when I am. Secondly, not everyone you test a presentation with is going to be very insightful. Many will just say they liked it. If you are lucky, you can find some of the most egregious errors and confusing parts. However, in preparing this presentation, I've been able to hone it into, what I feel now, is an order of magnitude better than what I had initially.
