Located on Queen Street in Hamilton, the Bermuda National Library houses a modest collection over two floors. They host a variety of events each month as well as promoting reading by offering periodic reading challenges.

Early in 2025, I participated in [Book Bingo](/posts/book-bingo) put on by the library.

They are currently (summer 2025) holding a Summer Reading Challenge, although only 4 books means it wasn't much of a challenge.
