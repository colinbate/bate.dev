Located on Queen Street in Hamilton, the Bermuda National Library houses a modest collection over two floors. They host a variety of events each month as well as promoting reading by offering periodic reading challenges.

Early in 2025, I participated in [Book Bingo](/posts/book-bingo) put on by the library.

They held a Summer Reading Challenge in 2025 as well, although only 4 books means it wasn't much of a challenge. Only 28 people finished (out of 60+ signed up).

I attended my first silent reading meetup at the library in August 2025 (I guess they do them monthly). Didn't realize they provided food for the event.
