A while ago I wrote about a [Reading Tracker](/posts/reading-tracker) tool that I wanted to make.

That wasn't the first time that I'd wanted to create that as I alluded to in that post. In fact, this is an app that has been on my "someday" list for a long time. I have found references to it in old notes from various points in my past.

Technically speaking, there isn't anything too complicated about creating a database-backed app to store the books, authors and series that I'm interested in tracking. The thing that alway seems to get me is not wanting to manually enter as much as possible. I want to be able to search for the books I read. And it looks like my fears are not unfounded as ChatGPT agrees that getting data from Amazon and/or Goodreads is likely to be a pain.

That said, we have put together a plan/spec that is a fair bit more fleshed out than anything I did prior.

Introducing [[Backstories]].

So now that I have a plan, the next step is to start building, with the help of [[Claude]] of course. If this sounds interesting to you as well, let me know. You can email `colin` at the domain of this site.

I will say that Claude doesn't always yield very optimal database usage.
