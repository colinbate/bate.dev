On Tuesday, I took my bike in for service and so had some time to kill in town on foot. I headed to the library as my usual destination to sit quietly. However, upon entering I saw a poster for a winter challenge. Specifically a Book Bingo challenge.

For anyone not familiar with the format, it follows the idea of American style Bingo with a grid of squares. Five by five is the normal grid, but in this case they are using a four by four, and the goal is to complete a line on the grid, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Instead of numbers on the grid, each space has a genre or theme for a book that you need to read to be able to check off.

Getting a line of four books completed can get me a prize, but completing the whole card (a blackout) can get me entered into a grand prize draw. I have no idea what the prizes or grand prize might be, and really that isn't the point. The point is to get a chance to step outside your comfort zone and read something new.

The categories are as follows:

I have read two so far (in green), and I have plans for the rest. I have until March 8 to finish the challenge. I will update this point periodically with my progress.
