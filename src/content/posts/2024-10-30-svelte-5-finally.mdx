As a massive Svelte fan, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of the stable version of Svelte 5 for quite some time now. I've been following the development process since the announcement at the end of last year. Now that it is stable, I'm very excited to see how the industry reacts to that and how third-party libraries will start to support it. Some have already updated to support it in its release candidate phase, but many have been waiting for the stable version.

But now it's available, it'll be exciting to see how the ecosystem catches up and what new things emerge. Some things may have been challenging in the past with the old reactivity model. We'll see how this new rune-based and signal-based approach changes things within the ecosystem, including best practices, recommendations, and libraries.

I've been working on a couple of Svelte 5 projects, some of which are currently using pre-release versions. So, I have bumped those up to the stable versions now. It is excellent to be able to do that before we hit production. Some of my personal projects have been in production with the pre-release version for a while now. Everything has been generally stable. I have only run into a few of the bugs and issues that have been fixed and resolved throughout the last year as the development process has continued. But it is nice to see how things have progressed, and in particular, the migration story looks smooth and straightforward. I have yet to do a massive migration myself. I do have an older project that I am keen to update, so I will migrate it shortly. Thankfully, you don't need to do it all at once. You can migrate component by component since it is generally backwards compatible at a component level.

I look forward to seeing how the community responds to this. As I continue working with it, I will try to post anything interesting I find.
