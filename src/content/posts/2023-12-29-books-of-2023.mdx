As 2023 draws to a close, amidst a sea of year-end retrospectives, I've decided to share my own review of the books I read this year. These selections span various genres, and while not all were published in 2023, that's when they caught my attention.

## Notes

- Only series that I read completely in 2023, or standalone books, are included.
- Ongoing series I read part of will be honorably mentioned below.
- LitRPG is not everyone's cup of tea, I know the stats can be confusing at first, but my recommendations here should be less intimidating options..

2. [The Murderbot Diaries Series by Martha Wells](https://www.goodreads.com/series/191900-the-murderbot-diaries)
   - An ongoing series with seven books so far, including "System Collapse" released this year.
   - Offers a unique blend of classic sci-fi and a sardonic narrative voice.

3. [Imperium of Terra Series by Evan Currie](https://www.goodreads.com/series/321423-imperium-of-terra)
   - Currently comprises "I Was Legion" and "Legion in Exile".
