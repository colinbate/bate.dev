In my last post, I mentioned looking at CloudFlare Access. I am using it as an authentication mechanism for my IndieAuth implementation. Great, but what is this IndieAuth you mention? That is a good question, as I only learned about it recently when I started researching the details of Micropub.

I should also elaborate on Micropub, a protocol for creating and managing published website entries. A site can annotate itself with a Micropub endpoint, and any compatible client software can use that endpoint to publish content. The mechanism client software uses to authenticate a user with that Micropub endpoint is called IndieAuth.

That said, IndieAuth is essentially an extension of OAuth2. However, there is one primary difference. With OAuth2, a relationship exists between the client software creator and the identity provider. In the IndieWeb world, any given site may roll its own identity provider, as I am attempting to do, so an arbitrary client should work with an arbitrary provider. In this case, the relationship exists between the identity provider and the Micropub endpoint it is protecting.

Maelstrom is the IndieAuth implementation I'm creating. It complements a Micropub implementation I also want to make called Tempest. In the future, this site may have some metadata in the HTML pointing to Tempest as an API and Maelstrom as its auth server. A client tool would be pointed at this site, find that metadata, and start a flow with Maelstrom to ensure I am the one using it. The client app would redirect the user (hopefully me) to Maelstrom, asking me if I'm fine allowing that client access to my endpoint. If I say yes, then it grants a token to the client that can be sent to Tempest as proof I am me. In this scenario, Tempest knows Maelstrom and trusts that I can authenticate using it.

It has been a fun exercise to work on. I've been using SvelteKit with CloudFlare Pages, focusing on the server-side aspects of SvelteKit. I am awaiting an upcoming change in the CloudFlare adapter for SvelteKit that should make apps with bindings defined easier to develop.

Once there is something functional to see, I'll post a link.
