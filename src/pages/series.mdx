This is a list of my favourite book series, ever.

It isn't in order of preference, it is currently arranged roughly by genre. And if you haven't heard me mention it before, my most consumed genres are Thriller, Fantasy, and Sci-fi with the LitRPG/Gamelit sub-genre featuring heavily.

Some of these are complete series where the author is finished to a satisfying conclusion. Those are marked with the series complete icon (<Icon icon="series-complete" class="size-6" />). Others have been slowly evolving for many years. Most of the long-lived thriller series are episodic enough that you could probably pick and choose any of the books to read without losing too much. That said, most have at least a minimal amount of overarching story to keep you reading.

In almost every case, the authors of these series have additional series that would certainly qualify for honourable mention. Some of these have spin-off series and yet others have feeder series.

If anyone wants more details on a particular series, or genre, please reach out. I can be emailed using my first name on this domain.
